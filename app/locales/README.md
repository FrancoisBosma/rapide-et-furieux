## i18n

This directory is to serve your locale translation files. JSON under this folder will be automagically loaded and registered with their filenames as locale code.

Check out [`vue-i18n`](https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next) for more details.
This project also uses [`vue-i18n-extract`](https://github.com/pixari/vue-i18n-extract) for adding/removing keys (not their translations though, which are left empty).

If you are using VS Code, [`i18n Ally`](https://github.com/lokalise/i18n-ally) is recommended to make the i18n experience better.
